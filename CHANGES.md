## Version 2.1.1 (in development)

* Prevent HTTP 500 errors when using the ODP Data Store. #937
* Spatial points are now parsed from CSV files when using the `read_csv()`operation.
  This is an option which can be disabled. #935
* Fixed a problem that prevented opening GeoJSON files
  in a workspace. #933
* Fixed a problem that prevented reopening workspaces using 
  the Web API when they referenced external files. #930
 

## Version 2.1.0

* Fixed DataAccessError in ODP Legacy Store [#924](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/924)
* Renamed legacy id's prefix from `esacci` to `cciold`
* Exchanged Cate's countries GeoJSON, by three new maps from https://www.naturalearthdata.com
  using 10m, 50m (default), and 110m resolutions. This fixes broken polyline and polygon 
  drawing in Cate Web UI [#912](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/912). See also
  https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate-webui/issues/11. 
* Cate Web API is now handling user preferences
* Added normalization method in order to handle datasets with zonal means 
  which have no longitude information.
* Increased robustness when using netcdf library
* Remodeled ODP Data Store to support newly designed CEDA OpenSearch Service. 
  The previous Data Store implementation is now available as "ESA CCI Open Data Portal Legacy".
* Iteratively adapted CCI Data Store to support newly provided data sets.    
* Cate Web API at now allows changes to the root path using environment variable JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_PREFIX. This is relevant to Catehub context where each user's cate service is mounted on /user/{username}/{cate-web-api-endpoint}.
* Cate Web API at `${endpoint}/` now reports whether it is running with a "user root directory". In this case, the Web API uses relative workspace path only and users connot escape the given user root directory.
* Cate Web API allows for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), which is required
  to run Cate UI in a browser.
* Added option `--traceback` to `cate-webapi-start` and `cate-webapi-stop` CLI tools.
* Added operation `write_zarr()` to write gridded datasets using the Zarr format.
* Updated `cate.core.wsmanag.WorkspaceManager` to work only with workspace paths relative to a given
  user root directory.
    - added `cate.core.pathmanag.PathManager` to ensure users cannot escape root directory
    - updated workspace handling: create/save/save_as/delete 
* Updated Python environment and fixed failing tests ([#817](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/817)
* Updated Cate code base with respect to `xarray` version 0.15
    - Changed minimum version requirement for xarray to 0.15 in environment.yml 
    - Changed `xarray.Dataset.drop` to `xarray.Dataset.drop_vars`
    - Removed `encoding` keyword argument from `xarray.DataArray` constructor calls.
    - No longer writing to `xarray.DataArray.values` property (e.g. Pearson's
      computation)
* Downloading of remote data from ODP now handles redirect of URL from HTTP to HTTPS [#919](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/919)

* Use only one variable (http_proxy) for proxy URL in conf.py. The value of this variable is then returned when
  get_config() is called. [#544](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/544)

## Version 2.0.0.dev8

* Removed the `cate-webapi` command-line tool and replaced it by two others:
  * `cate-webapi-start` to start the Cate WebAPI service.
  * `cate-webapi-stop` to start the Cate WebAPI service. This script executes
    fast, as it will will not longer import any of the many packages Cate depends on.

  [#569](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/569), using Tornado 5 webserver now.

## Version 2.0.0.dev6

* Activate script missing after "cate-cli" package installation
  [#569](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/569)
* Keep configuration of data stores path 
  [#439](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/439)

## Version 2.0.0.dev5

* Select long rectangles with ``subset_spatial()``
  [#541](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/541)
* Improve performance of ``subset_spatial()``, especially when masking complex polygons
  [#508](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/508)
* Select all pixels that are crossed by the given polygon in ``subset_spatial()``
  [#560](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/560)

### Fixes

* CF valid_range not respected in data visualisation
  [#537](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/537)

## Version 2.0.0.dev1

### Improvements and new Features

* Added `data_frame_min(df)` and `data_frame_max(df)` operations to select features by min/max
  [#492](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/492)
* Added `data_frame_query(df, expr)` operation to query features
  [#486](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/486).
  If the data frame `df` contains a geometry column (a `GeoDataFrame` object),
  then the query expression `expr` can also contain geometric relationship tests,
  for example the expression
  `"population > 100000 and @within('-20, 40, 20, 80')"`
  could be used on a data frame to query for larger cities in Europe.
* Removed operation `read_geo_data_collection`. The preferred operation to read
  feature attribute tables ("data frames") with geometries from ESRI Shapefiles and GeoJSON files is
  `read_geo_data_frame`.
* CLI now launches a lot faster, e.g. try now `cate -h`
  [#58](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/58)
* Cate can now produce animated figures
  [#86](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/86)

  [#496](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/496)
* Resolve a bug with wrong file open mode
  [#497](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/497)

## Version 1.0 (10.10.2017)

### Improvements and new Features

* List only data sources tested by the champion users
  [#435](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/435)
* Global temporal attributes are adjusted automatically when opening new datasets
* Global temporal attributes are adjusted automatically when converting from data frames
* Normalization and subsetting operation implementation logic is refactored out to util so that it can be re-used throughout Cate

### Fixes

* Get rid of Python user warnings
  [#446](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/446)
* Missing static background map
  [#453](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/453)
* Fixed displaying broken/incomplete/canceled data sources on local data sources list
  [#375](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/375)
* Generated resource names not always unique
  [#391](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/391)
* Multiple concurrent attempts to load the ODP index now always return the same result
  [#386](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/386)
* Use global temporal attributes to determine temporal resolution in aggregation operations
  [#340](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/340)
* Only allow valid python identifiers as resource names
  [#436](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/436)
* OS X installation error
  [#438](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/438)

## Version 0.9.0

### Improvements and new Features

* Added check if copying/downloading DS failed without any progress/complete files
  if so, remove empty DS
  [#375](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/375)
* Min/max computation should be monitored
  [#384](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/384)
* Added API to annotate deprecated operations and operation input/outputs.
  Refer to `op`, `op_input`, `op_output` decorators in `cate.op`.
  [#381](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/381)
* Configure default color maps
  [#372](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/372)
* Hide problematic ODP data sources
  [#368](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/368)
* Coregistration operation now works on n-dimensional datasets
  [#36](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/36)
* Add use case 2 script [#327](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/327)
  and [#146](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/146)
* long_term_average, temporal_aggregation, detect_outliers, spatial_subset and plot now work with both - datasets and dataframes.
* Unified backend of CLI and GUI on WebSocket [#120](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/120)
  As the GUI uses WebSocket, this remove a bit of duplicated code.
* The `pearson_correlation` operation has been split into two operations:
  * `pearson_correlation_simple` that produces a single pair of a correlation
    coefficient and a probability value for the given timeseries.
  * `pearson_correlation_map` produces a map of correlation coefficients and p-values
    and outputs this as a dataset that can be worked with further.
  Performance of pearson correlation has been radically improved. In addition, the operations can now
  accept both, a dataset and a dataframe and a map can be created also by
  performing correlation of a single timeseries against all spatial points in the
  other dataset.
* A uniform way of handling spatiotemporal global attributes has been introduced
* External executables such as the *CCI Land Cover User Tool*, the *CCI SST Regridding Tool*, or
  the *MPI Climate Data Operators* can now be registered as operations.
* In summary, workflows can now have steps of the following types:
  - A step that invokes a registered Cate operation, which is the default
    ```json
    {
         "op": <qualified op name>
    }
    ```
  - A step that invokes an external executable
    ```json
    {
         "command": <command pattern>,
         "cwd": <current working directory>
         "env": <dict of environment variables>
    }
    ```
  - A step that invokes another (JSON) workflow
    ```json
    {
         "workflow": <workflow JSON path>
    }
    ```
  - A step that executes a Python expression
    ```json
    {
         "expression": <Python expression>
    }
    ```
* Searching data sources from the CLI using "cate ds list -n" now matches against id and title
* Added `plot_scatter` and `plot_contour` operations ([#278](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues/278)).
* Most `plot_` operations now have a new `title` parameter.
* A function annotated by one of the operator decorators (`@op`, `@op_input`, `@op_return`, `@op_output`)
  will be turned into an *operation registration* which is also callable.
  Calling the *operation registration* will validate all inputs and then pass arguments and
  keyword-arguments to the actual, original function.
* New `FileLike` type.
* Changed the JSON object representation of a (xarray/NetCDF-CF) variable to include all variable
  attributes. This changes the the response of various REST/WebSocket calls that return a workspace.
