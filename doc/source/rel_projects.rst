Given here is a limited selection of related projects that have been developed for climate problems or can deal
with climate data.

Iris
====

`Iris <http://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/index.html>`_ seeks to provide a powerful, easy to use, and
community-driven Python library for analysing and visualising meteorological and oceanographic data sets.

With Iris you can:

* Use a single API to work on your data, irrespective of its original format.
* Read and write (CF-)netCDF, GRIB, and PP files.
* Easily produce graphs and maps via integration with matplotlib and cartopy.


AOCW
====

The `Apache Open Climate Workbench <https://climate.apache.org/>`_ is Python library for common model evaluation tasks
 as well as a flexible RESTful API, which allows integrating the capabilities of the toolkit into their workflow
regardless of language and environment by performing HTTP requests.


GrADS
=====

The `Grid Analysis and Display System <http://grads.iges.org/grads>`_, it is a desktop application which reads,
manipulates, and visualizes gridded 4D data, provides a command line interface with a proprietary language and
interfaces to Python, Perl, IDL, Matlab.

SNAP
====

`SNAP <http://step.esa.int/main/toolboxes/snap/>`_, the ESA platform for the Sentinel-1, -2, -3 Toolboxes, and SMOS-Box provide
numerous specific readers for Earth Observation data and generic data processors (binning, reprojection, collocation,
band-maths, etc) which can also be used for ESA CCI Data. A future extension of the CCI Toolbox will allow
to use SNAP data readers and processors and therefore allow for interesting synergistic use of CCI data
with Level-1 and Level-2 optical, microwave and SAR data.
