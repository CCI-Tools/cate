    information, including original coordinates, is preserved.

    :param ds: The dataset from which to perform selection.
    :param var: One or more variable names to select and preserve in the dataset. \
    All of these are valid 'var_name' 'var_name1,var_name2,var_name3' ['var_name1', 'var_name2']. \
    One can also use wildcards when doing the selection. E.g., choosing 'var_name*' for selection \
    will select all variables that start with 'var_name'. This can be used to select variables \
    along with their auxiliary variables, to select all uncertainty variables, and so on.
