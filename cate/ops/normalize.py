    Normalize the geo- and time-coding upon opening the given dataset w.r.t.
    to a common (CF-compatible) convention used within Cate. This will maximize the compatibility of
    a dataset for usage with Cate's operations.

    That is,
    * variables named "latitude" will be renamed to "lat";
    * variables named "longitude" or "long" will be renamed to "lon";

    Then, for equi-rectangular grids,
    * Remove 2D "lat" and "lon" variables;
    * Two new 1D coordinate variables "lat" and "lon" will be generated from original 2D forms.

    Finally, it will be ensured that a "time" coordinate variable will be of type *datetime*.
