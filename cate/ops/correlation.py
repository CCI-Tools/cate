    Do product moment `Pearson's correlation <http://www.statsoft.com/Textbook/Statistics-Glossary/P/button/p#Pearson%20Correlation>`_ analysis.

    For more information how to interpret the results, see
    `here <http://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab-express/1/help-and-how-to/modeling-statistics/regression/how-to/correlation/interpret-the-results/>`_,

    The provided variables have to have the same shape, but depending on the
    type of variables and chosen correlation type, not necessarily the same
    definition for all dimensions. E.g., it is possible to correlate two
    datasets of the same area at different times.

    If two 1D or 2D variables are provided, a single pair of correlation
    coefficient and p_value will be calculated and returned, as well as
    optionally saved in a text file.

    In case 3D time/lat/lon variables are provided, a correlation will be
    perfomed according to the given correlation type. In case a pixel_by_pixel
    correlation is chosen, the datasets have to have the same lat/lon
    definition, so that a 2D lat/lon map of correlation coefficients, as well
    as p_values can be constructed.

    There are 'x' and 'y' datasets. Positive correlations imply that as x
    grows, so does y. Negative correlations imply that as x increases, y
    decreases.

    :param ds_x: The 'x' dataset
    :param var_y: Dataset variable to use for correlation analysis in the 'dependent' dataset
    :param var_x: Dataset variable to use for correlation analysis in the 'variable' dataset
    :param file: Filepath variable. If given, this is where the results will be saved in a text file.
    :param corr_type: Correlation type to use for 3D time/lat/lon variables.
