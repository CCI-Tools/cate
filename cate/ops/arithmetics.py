    Do arithmetic operations on the given dataset by providing a list of
    arithmetic operations and the corresponding constant. The operations will
    be applied to the dataset in the order in which they appear in the list.
    For example:

    Currently supported arithmetic operations:
    log,log10,log2,log1p,exp,+,-,/,*

        log - natural logarithm

        log2 - base 2 logarithm
        log1p - log(1+x)
        exp - the exponential

    The operations will be applied element-wise to all arrays of the dataset.
