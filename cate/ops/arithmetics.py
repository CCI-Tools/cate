    Calculate the difference of two datasets (ds - ds2). This is done by
    matching variable names in the two datasets against each other and taking
    the difference of matching variables.

    If lat/lon/time extents differ between the datasets, the default behavior
    is to take the intersection of the datasets and run subtraction on that.
    However, broadcasting is possible. E.g. ds(lat/lon/time) - ds(lat/lon) is
    valid. In this case the subtrahend will be stretched to the size of
    ds(lat/lon/time) so that it can be subtracted. This also works if the
    subtrahend is a single time slice of arbitrary temporal position. In this
    case, the time dimension will be squeezed out leaving a lat/lon dataset.
