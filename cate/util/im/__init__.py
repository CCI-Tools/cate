Description
===========

The ``cate.util.im`` package provides application-independent utility functions for working with tiled image pyramids.

The Cate project uses this package for implementing a RESTful web service that provides image tiles from image pyramids.

This package is independent of other ``cate.*``packages, but it depends on the following external packages

* numpy
* pillow (for PIL)
* matplotlib


Verification
============

The module's unit-tests are located in
`test/util/im <https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate-core/blob/master/test/util/im>`_ and may be executed using
``$ py.test test/util/im --cov=cate/util/im`` for extra code coverage information.
