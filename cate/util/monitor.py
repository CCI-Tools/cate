Description
===========

This module defines the :py:class:`Monitor` interface that may be used by functions and methods
that offer support for observation and control of long-running tasks.

The module also provides a simple but still useful default implementation :py:class:`ConsoleMonitor`, which
prints progress output directly to the console.

class Monitor(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """
    A monitor is used to both observe and control a running task.

    The ``Monitor`` class is an abstract base class for concrete monitors.
    Derived classes must implement the following three abstract methods:
    :py:meth:`start`, :py:meth:`progress`, and :py:meth:`done`.
    Derived classes must implement also the following two abstract methods, if they want cancellation support:
    :py:meth:`cancel` and :py:meth:`is_cancelled`.

    Pass ``Monitor.NULL`` to functions that expect a monitor instead of passing ``None``.

    Given here is an example of how progress monitors should be used by functions:::

        def long_running_task(a, b, c, monitor):
            with monitor.starting('doing a long running task', total_work=100)
                # do 30% of the work here
                monitor.progress(work=30)
                # do 70% of the work here
                monitor.progress(work=70)

    If a function makes calls to other functions that also support a monitor, a *child-monitor* is used:::

        def long_running_task(a, b, c, monitor):
            with monitor.starting('doing a long running task', total_work=100)
                # let other_task do 30% of the work
                other_task(a, b, c, monitor=monitor.child(work=30))
                # let other_task do 70% of the work
                other_task(a, b, c, monitor=monitor.child(work=70))
