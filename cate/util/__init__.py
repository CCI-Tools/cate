Description
===========

The ``cate.util`` package provides application-independent utility functions.

This package is independent of other ``cate.*``packages and can therefore be used stand-alone.

Verification
============

The module's unit-tests are located in
`test/util <https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/blob/master/test/util>`_ and may be executed using
``$ py.test test/util --cov=cate/util`` for extra code coverage information.
