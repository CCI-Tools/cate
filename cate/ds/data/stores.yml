    This data store represents the [ESA CCI Open Data Portal](http://cci.esa.int/data)
    in the CCI Toolbox. It currently provides all CCI data that are published through
    an OpenSearch interface. The store will be extended shortly to also provide TIFF
    and Shapefile Data. Remote data downloaded to your computer is made available
    through the *File Data Sources*.

    A data store that contains selected datasets from the CCI Open Data Portal
    which have been converted to [Zarr format](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/)
    and placed in [JASMIN](https://jasmin.ac.uk/) Object Storage.
    Its datasets are expected to offer a much better access performance compared to the
    CCI Open Data Portal that uses OPeNDAP as data transport protocol.
    The CCI Zarr Store is still experimental, but it is planned to further
    develop and extend it successively.
