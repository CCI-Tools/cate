# If 'use_workspace_imagery_cache' is True, Cate will maintain a per-workspace
# cache for imagery generated from dataset variables. Such cache can accelerate
# image display, however at the cost of disk space.

# Include/exclude data sources (currently effective in Cate Desktop GUI only, not used by API, CLI).
#
# If 'included_data_sources' is a list, its entries are expected to be wildcard patterns for the identifiers of data
# sources to be included. By default, or if 'included_data_sources' is None, all data sources are included.
# If 'excluded_data_sources' is a list, its entries are expected to be wildcard patterns for the identifiers of data
# sources to be excluded. By default, or if 'excluded_data_sources' is None, no data sources are excluded.
# If both 'included_data_sources' and 'excluded_data_sources' are lists, we first include data sources using
# 'included_data_sources' then remove entries that match any result from applying 'excluded_data_sources'.
#
# We put wildcards here that match all data sources that are known to work in GUI
