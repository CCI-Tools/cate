Data Access
-----------

1. When running Cate / Cate Desktop on Windows and accessing data from the ESA Open Data Portal,
   you may receive a **SSL certificate verify failed** error.
   The workaround is to visit the `ESGF Portal at CEDA`_ web side using Edge, Chrome, or Firefox.
   This will cause your browser to register the website URL in question with your operating system's
   trusted SSL certificates. See also `Issue #64`_.

2. Not all datasets from offered by the `ESA CCI Open Data Portal`_ can be used in Cate.
   Please check the `ODP Datasets and Data Access Issues`_ page to see whether you problem with
   a dataset is known and if there are already fixes / workarounds.
