Operation Specifications
========================


In this section, the non-trivial operations and data processors used in the ESA CCI Toolbox are specified.
The term *operation* used here first refers to CCI Toolbox functions that will become part of the API as usual Python
functions. Secondly and at  the same time it refers to instances of such functions that are stored along
with additional meta-data in the CCI Toolbox *operation registry* as described in :ref:`op`. The latter will be used to
allow invocation of functions from the CCI Toolbox' command-line interface (CLI) and desktop application (GUI).

The intended readership of this chapter are software end users wishing to understand the details of the algorithms
and methods used in the CCI Toolbox.
