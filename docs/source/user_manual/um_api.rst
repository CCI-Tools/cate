Cate Python API
===============

Python programmers can use Cate's Python API by two means

1. installing the ``cate``  package directly from sources
2. installing the ``cate`` package as a Conda package into their Miniconda3/Anaconda3 environment.

Note, Cate is not yet available through `pip` (i.e. from PyPi, the common Python Package Index).

For detailed instruction, please follow the `README <https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/blob/master/README.md>`_
in Cate's GitHub repository.
