Command-Line Interface
======================

Overview
========

The CCI Toolbox comprises a single command-line executable, which is called ``cate`` and is available after installing
the CCI Toolbox on your computer. See section :doc:`um_setup` for more information. The command-line
interface allows for accessing local and remote datasets as well as running virtually all CCI Toolbox
operations on them.

The most easy way to use ``cate`` is running the ``cate-cli`` script found in ``bin`` directory of your CCI Toolbox
installation directory. Windows and Unix users will find a link to this script in their start menu or on their desktop.
Opening the link will open a new console / terminal window configured to run ``cate``.

**Developers only:** If you build and install the CCI Toolbox from Python sources into your current Python environment,
``cate`` will be registered as an executable script. It can be found as ``$PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/cate.sh`` on Unix systems
and as ``%PYTHON_PREFIX%\\Scripts\\cate.exe`` on Windows systems where ``PYTHON_PREFIX`` is the path to the current
Python environment.

In the console / terminal window type::

    cate -h

This should output the following usage help:::

   usage: cate [-h] [--version] [--traceback] [--license] [--docs] COMMAND ...

   ESA CCI Toolbox (Cate) command-line interface, version 2.0

   positional arguments:
     COMMAND      One of the following commands. Type "COMMAND -h" to get
                  command-specific help.
       ds         Manage data sources.
       op         Manage data operations.
       ws         Manage workspaces.
       res        Manage workspace resources.
       run        Run an operation or Workflow file.
       io         Manage supported data and file formats.
       upd        Update an existing cate environment to a specific or to the
                  latest cate version

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help   show this help message and exit
     --version    show program's version number and exit
     --traceback  show (Python) stack traceback for the last error
     --license    show software license and exit
     --docs       show software documentation in a browser window



``cate`` uses up to two sub-command levels. Each sub-command has its own set of options and arguments and can display
help when used with the option ```--help`` or ``-h``. The first sub-command level comprises the following list of
commands:

* :ref:`cli_cate_ds`
* :ref:`cli_cate_op`
* :ref:`cli_cate_run`

The following first level sub-commands are used to work interactively with datasets and operations:

* :ref:`cli_cate_ws`
* :ref:`cli_cate_res`

When you encounter any error while using ``cate`` and you want to `report the problem <https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate/issues>`_
to the development team, we kindly ask you to rerun the command with option ``--traceback`` and include the Python stack
traceback with a short description of your problem.


Examples
========

The following examples shall help you understand the basic concepts behind the various ``cate`` commands.

Manage datasets
---------------

To list all available data sources, type::

    cate ds list

To query all data sources that have ``ozone`` in their name, type::

    cate ds list -n ozone

To get more detailed information on a specific data source, e.g. ``esacci.OZONE.mon.L3...``, type::

    cate ds info esacci.OZONE.mon.L3.NP.multi-sensor.multi-platform.MERGED.fv0002.r1

To add a local data source from all NetCDF files in e.g. ``data/sst_v3`` and name it e.g. ``SSTV3``, type::

    cate ds def SSTV3 data/sst_v3/*.nc

Make sure it is there::

    cate ds list -n SSTV3

To make a temporal subset ECV data source locally available, i.e. avoid remote data access during its usage::

    cate ds copy esacci.OZONE.mon.L3.NP.multi-sensor.multi-platform.MERGED.fv0002.r1 -t 2006-01-01,2007-12-31

The section Configuration in :doc:`um_setup` describes, how to configure the location of directory in which
Cate stores such synchronised data.

Inspect available operations
----------------------------

To list all available operations, type::

    cate op list

To display more details about a particular operation, e.g. ``tseries_point``, type::

    cate op info tseries_point

Run an operation
----------------

The ``cate run`` command is used to execute single operations. The ``open`` and ``read`` options are used to
ingest datasets which can then be referenced by name. A ``write`` option allows to write the operation result into a
file.

To run the ``tseries_point`` operation on a dataset, e.g. the ``local.SSTV3`` (from above), at lat=0 and lon=0, type::

    cate run --open ds=local.SSTV3 --write ts2.nc tseries_point ds=ds lat=0 lon=0

To run the ``tseries_point`` operation on a netCDF file, e.g. ``test/ui/precip_and_temp.nc`` at lat=0 and lon=0, type::

    cate run --read ds=test/ui/precip_and_temp.nc --write ts2.nc tseries_point ds=ds lat=0 lon=0


Interactive session
-------------------

The following command sequence is a simple example for an interactive session using the Cate command-line::

    cate ws new
    cate res open sst local.SSTV3
    cate res set sst_ts tseries_point ds=@sst lat=0 lon=0
    cate res plot sst_ts
    cate res write sst_ts sst_ts.nc
    cate ws status

The steps above explained:

1. ``cate ws new`` is used to create a new in-memory *workspace*. A workspace can hold any number of
   named *workspace resources* which may refer to opened datasets or any other ingested or computed objects.
2. ``cate res open`` is used to open a dataset from the available data stores and
   assign the opened dataset to the workspace resource ``sst``. Accordingly, ``cate res read`` could have been used to
   read from a local netCDF file.
3. ``cate res set`` assigns the result of the ``tseries_point`` operation to workspace resource ``sst_ts``. Note the
   at-character "@" used as prefix for the input ``ds``. This indicates that value for input ``ds`` of
   step ``tseries_point`` will be retrieved "at" the ``open`` step named ``sst``. It establishes a connection
   between step ``open`` and ``tseries_point``. In fact, this is the way processing graphs are constructed using
   the CLI.
4. ``cate res plot`` plots the workspace resource ``sst_ts``.
5. ``cate res write`` writes the workspace resource ``sst_ts`` to a netCDF file ``./sst_ts.nc``.
6. ``cate ws status`` shows the current workspace status and lists all workspace resource assignments.

We could now save the current workspace state and close it::

    cate ws save
    cate ws close

``cate ws save`` creates a hidden sub-directory ``.cate-workspace`` and herewith makes the current directory a
*workspace directory*. ``cate`` uses this hidden directory to persist the workspace state information.
At a later point in time, you could ``cd`` into any of your workspace directories, and::

    cate ws open
    cate ws status

in order to reopen it, display its status, and continue interactively working with its resources.
