Investigation of Relationships between Ice Sheet ECV Parameters
===============================================================

:User Types:
    * Earth system science community

:Problem Definition: A scientist wants to gain insight into the relationship between the Ice Sheets CCI ECV
    parameters. At first, Surface Elevation Change (SEC), Ice Velocity (IV), and Gravitational Mass Balance (GMB)
    are compared. Afterwards, a basin-wise comparison of Surface Elevation Change averages and Gravimetry Mass
    Balance averages is conducted. And finally, vector and grid data are compared by co-plotting of IV and
    Calving Front Location (CFL) data. Additionally, it would be interesting to examine the relationships between
    sea ice, SST around Greenland, glacier melt respectively cloud cover and SEC/IV.

:Required Toolbox Features:
    * Access to and ingestion of CCI Ie Sheets ECV data (SEC, IV, GMB)
    * Re-gridding of all data to the SEC grid
    * Display the data as different layers
    * Calculation of the IV vector magnitude (per pixel) and display as a new layer
    * Temporal interpolation of the SEC data to the GMB data times
    * Calculation of the correlation coefficient (per pixel) between the SEC data and the GMB data for a given GMB
      measurement time, display as a new layer
    * Access to and ingestion of a polygon shapefile corresponding to one of the GMB basins
    * Filtering of the SEC values and the GMB values; discarding of the ones outside the GMB basin polygon
    * Calculation of the average of the GMB and SEC values inside the basin polygon for each point in the time series
    * Plotting of the averaged values in a time series plot, comparison with the provided GMB total basin values
    * Access to and ingestion of the CCI Ice Sheets CFL time series; each element in the time series is a set of (lon/lat) line
      segments
    * Plotting of the CFL line segments on top of the IV magnitude for different years

:Optional:
    * Access to and ingestion of CCI ECV data (sea ice, SST, glaciers, clouds)
    * Re-gridding of all data to the SEC grid
    * Temporal and spatial subsetting
    * Calculation of correlation coefficients
    * Visualisation and export

Analysis of Equatorial Aerosol and Cloud Features using Hovmöller Diagrams
==========================================================================


:User Types:
    * Earth system science community

:Problem Definition: A scientist wants to analyze the relation of aerosols and clouds in the equatorial region 
    (5° S–5° N) by means of Hovmöller diagrams displaying the equatorial mean value as portion of the mean value
    over all latitudes for cloud fraction and aerosol optical depth (y-axis e.g. months since 1980, x-axis 
    longitudes e.g. 100° W–80° E).

:Required Toolbox Features:
    * Access to and ingestion of ESA CCI Aerosol and Cloud data 
    * Geometric adjustments
    * Temporal subsetting
    * Calculation of requested anomaly values and side-by-side display of Hovmöller diagrams
