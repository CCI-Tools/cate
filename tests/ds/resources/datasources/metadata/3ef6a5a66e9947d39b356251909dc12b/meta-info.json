  "abstract": "The ESA Sea State Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project has produced global daily merged multi-sensor time-series of along-track satellite altimeter significant wave height data (referred to as Level 3 (L3) data) with a particular focus for use in climate studies.\n\nThis dataset contains the Version 1.1 edited Remote Sensing Significant Wave Height product, along-track at approximately 6 km spatial resolution, which have been generated from upstream Sea State CCI L2P products, edited and merged into daily products, retaining only valid and good quality measurements from all altimeters over one day, with simplified content (only a few key parameters). This is close to what is delivered in Near-Real Time by the CMEMS (Copernicus - Marine Environment Monitoring Service) project. \n\nThis first version of Sea State CCI products is inherited from the GlobWave project building on experience and existing outputs. It extends and improves the GlobWave products which were a post-processing over existing L2 altimeter agency products with additional filtering, corrections and variables. A major improvement consists in a new denoised sea surface height variable using Empirical Mode Decomposition.\n\nThe altimeter data used in the Sea State CCI dataset v1.1 come from multiple satellite missions spanning from 1991 to 2018 (ERS-1, ERS-2, Topex, Envisat, GFO, CryoSat-2, Jason-1, Jason-2, Jason-3, SARAL). Many altimeters are bi-frequency (Ku-C or Ku-S) and only measurements in Ku band were used, for consistency reasons, being available on each altimeter but SARAL (Ka band).",
