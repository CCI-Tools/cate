**Please read this carefully before submitting a new issue:**

1. Make sure the issue you are about to report has not been reported before! 
2. If you are allowed to assign labels, please 
   * Use label "support_request" if you have a question
   * Use label "help_wanted" if you are a Cate developer and you have an issue that falls 
     completely in your scope of activity, but with which you are stuck with and need help with. 
   * Use label "discussion" for an issue that doesn't warrant code changes right away, 
     but is rather meant as a place for discussion on how to solve a particular problem. 
3. The following template should be used for reporting bugs, inconsistencies, and feature requests.
   Note that you can use hashtag followed by issue number to refer to other issues (e.g. #234) and 
   use the add character followed by a GitHub user name (e.g. @forman) to refer to other users.
